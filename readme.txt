# OP_CAT Vault Implementation

## Overview

This repository documents my exploration and attempt to create a secure vault using OP_CAT technology within the Bitcoin scripting context. OP_CAT is a dynamic scripting operation in Bitcoin that concatenates data on the stack. This project aims to leverage OP_CAT to enhance security features within a custom vault implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Bitcoin Core (for blockchain simulation)
- [bit](https://github.com/ofek/bit) library (for Bitcoin-related operations)
- (Any other libraries/tools specific to your implementation)

## Getting Started

    cd opcat-vault
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Any other steps needed to set up your project)

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the OP_CAT vault implementation.
